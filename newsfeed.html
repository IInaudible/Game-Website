                <p>The cutest sea critters are otters. I can't get enough of them, and it hurts to see them being affected by improper disposal of plastic waste,
                    and even worse they're not the only ones. The amount of space that the waste takes up is unreal. The amount of creatures affected by it is even
                    more unbelievable. Please help and contribute by signing this petition to get rid of some of the plastic waste in the ocean.

                <p>I see people looking at the bigger picture, blaming waste management companies for how they dispose of their waste. Let's take a look at the 
                little picture. You, if you're reading this and don't litter good for you that is an accomplishment. However there is a percentage of people out there reading
                this that still litter, and to those people I want you to know that it isn't as simple as "1 candy wrapper" because there are millions of people that think the
                exact same way. Then you end up with a 2 ton pile of plastic. So please do not litter and spread the word.

                <p>Ducks are drowing in plastic. LITERALLY! Sign this petition to stop plastic pollution in the ocean and help save the ducks. Even it's a small amount
                of their population being affected, zero ducks should be getting hurt or dying to plastic pollution. There is no reason not to sign this petition if it
                doesn't cost you anything but acouple of minutes and buys the little duckies a lifetime freedom and hapiness.</p>
